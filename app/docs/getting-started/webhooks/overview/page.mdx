# Webhooks Overview

<Spacer />

Trackify webhooks allow your application to receive real-time notifications about important events, such as when a link is clicked, created, updated, or deleted. This enables you to automate workflows, update analytics, or trigger custom logic in your own systems.

<Spacer />

## How Webhooks Work

<Spacer />

A webhook is an event-driven way for Trackify to notify your application when something happens such as a link being clicked or created. 

<Spacer />

Instead of constantly polling the Trackify API for updates, your server simply listens for incoming HTTP POST requests from Trackify when relevant events occur.

Webhooks are **asynchronous**: Trackify will send the event as soon as possible, but delivery is not guaranteed to be instant or even successful (for example, if your server is down).  
**Do not** use webhooks for critical, synchronous flows where you must confirm delivery before proceeding. Instead, use webhooks for tasks like updating analytics, sending notifications, or triggering background jobs. For real-time, guaranteed flows (like onboarding), use direct API calls and treat webhooks as a supplement for automation and monitoring.

## Supported Events

<Spacer />

Trackify currently supports the following webhook events:

- <code>link_created</code>
- <code>link_updated</code>
- <code>link_deleted</code>
- <code>link_clicked</code>

<Spacer />

## Example Payload: `link_clicked`

<Spacer />

When a user clicks a Trackify link, a `link_clicked` event is sent to your webhook endpoint with the following payload structure:

<CodeDisplay
  language="json"
  codeString={`{
  "type": "link_clicked",
  "data": {
    "shortId": "abc123",
    "ip": "102.123.45.67",
    "country": "Kenya",
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 Chrome/113.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
    "geo": {
      "city": "Nairobi",
      "region": "Nairobi County",
      "lat": -1.2921,
      "lon": 36.8219
    },
    "deviceInfo": {
      "type": "desktop"
    }
  }
}`}
/>

## Securing Your Webhook Endpoint

<Spacer />

To ensure that incoming webhook requests are genuinely from Trackify and have not been tampered with, each webhook request includes a signature header:  
`x-webhook-signature`

You should verify this signature in your backend before processing the event.

<Spacer />

### Example: Verifying the Webhook Signature (Node.js)

<CodeDisplay
  language="typescript"
  codeString={`import express from "express";
import { TrackifyWebhook } from "trackify-sdk";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

const webhookSecret = process.env.TRACKIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET!;

app.post("/webhook/trackify", (req, res) => {
  try {
    const event = TrackifyWebhook.verifyPayload(
      webhookSecret,
      JSON.stringify(req.body),
      { "x-webhook-signature": req.headers["x-webhook-signature"] as string }
    );
    // Handle the event (e.g., update your database)
    res.status(200).send("Received");
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(400).send("Invalid signature");
  }
});

app.listen(3001, () => console.log("Listening for webhooks on port 3001"));
`}
/>

<Spacer />

**Key parts to note:**  
- Endpoint path: <code>"/webhook/trackify"</code>  
- Signature header: <code>"x-webhook-signature"</code>  
- Success response: <code>"Received"</code>  
- Error response: <code>"Invalid signature"</code>

<Spacer />

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:**  
> Always keep your webhook secret safe and never expose it in client-side code. Only accept POST requests from trusted sources, and validate the signature for every incoming webhook.
