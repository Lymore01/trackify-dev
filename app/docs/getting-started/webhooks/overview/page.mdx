# Webhooks Overview

<Spacer />

Trackify webhooks allow your application to receive real-time notifications about important events, such as when a link is clicked, created, updated, or deleted. This enables you to automate workflows, update analytics, or trigger custom logic in your own systems.

<Spacer />

## How Webhooks Work

<Spacer />

A webhook is an event-driven way for Trackify to notify your application when something happens such as a link being clicked or created. 

<Spacer />

Instead of constantly polling the Trackify API for updates, your server simply listens for incoming HTTP POST requests from Trackify when relevant events occur.

Webhooks are **asynchronous**: Trackify will send the event as soon as possible, but delivery is not guaranteed to be instant or even successful (for example, if your server is down).  
**Do not** use webhooks for critical, synchronous flows where you must confirm delivery before proceeding. Instead, use webhooks for tasks like updating analytics, sending notifications, or triggering background jobs. For real-time, guaranteed flows (like onboarding), use direct API calls and treat webhooks as a supplement for automation and monitoring.

## Supported Events

<Spacer />

Trackify currently supports the following webhook events:

- `link_created`
- `link_updated`
- `link_deleted`
- `link_clicked`

<Spacer />

## Example Payload: `link_clicked`

<Spacer />

When a user clicks a Trackify link, a `link_clicked` event is sent to your webhook endpoint with the following payload structure:

<CodeDisplay
  language="json"
  codeString={`{
  "type": "link_clicked",
  "data": {
    "shortId": "abc123",
    "ip": "102.123.45.67",
    "country": "Kenya",
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 Chrome/113.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
    "geo": {
      "city": "Nairobi",
      "region": "Nairobi County",
      "lat": -1.2921,
      "lon": 36.8219
    },
    "deviceInfo": {
      "type": "desktop"
    }
  }
}`}
/>

## Securing Your Webhook Endpoint

<Spacer />

To ensure that incoming webhook requests are genuinely from Trackify and have not been tampered with, each webhook request includes a signature header:  
`x-webhook-signature`

You should verify this signature in your backend before processing the event.

<Spacer />

### Example: Verifying the Webhook Signature (Node.js)

<CodeDisplay
  language="typescript"
  codeString={`import Webhook from "trackify-sdk/webhook";

const secret = process.env.TRACKIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET!;

const webhook = new Webhook(secret);

try {
  const event = webhook.verify(
    req.body, // raw request body as string or Buffer
    { "webhook-signature": req.headers["x-webhook-signature"] as string }
  );
  // Process the event
} catch (err) {
  // Invalid signature or malformed payload
  res.status(400).send("Invalid webhook signature");
}
`}
/>

<Spacer />

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:**  
> Always keep your webhook secret safe and never expose it in client-side code. Only accept POST requests from trusted sources, and validate the signature for every incoming webhook.
